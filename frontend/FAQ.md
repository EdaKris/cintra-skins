## > HOW DO I *ACTUALLY* USE THE TEMPLATES???
1. Open them with your favorite art program of choice.
2. Pick layers for the parts you want to color. These layers are always in Linear Light Mode.
3. Alpha Lock those layers.
4. Select a color from your color wheel and fill the locked layer with it.
5. Repeat this process until the colors "look right" to you.
6. Add the details that you want. This can range from different texture materials, engravings, panel lining, decals, and text. This step is optional.
7. Hit **"Save as PSD"** and name the new skin. (e.g: `yourSkinName.psd)

/// Anything further this point is *technically* optional, but you'd be saving way more time instead of wasting it copying and renaming and deleting pngs into your Skin Folder.

1. Open the model of the skin you're making in Blender.
2. Go to the `Shading` Tab. You may find Texture Slots like "HUD" or "Dial", so pick the Slot you actually want to change.
3. Find the Image Texture node assigned to the `Base Texture`.
4. Hit the `X` button to remove the current texture.
5. Hit the Folder icon that appears next to it and load `yourSkinName.psd` to apply the texture to the model.
6. Percieve what you have created. Revel in it, but not for long.
7. Touch up anything else in the `psd` that needs more adjustment and hit save to see the changes. Repeat this process until you're satisfied with the final result.

/// "Optional" Blender Segment over

8. Export the finished texture as a `png` file.
9. Copy that `png` into your Ultraskins-GC custom folder.
10. Rename it into its proper internal file name. (e.g: your Shotgun skin NEEDS to be named `T_ShotgunNew.png` .

## > HOW TO UPSCALE TEMPLATE WITHOUT BLURRING THE TEXTURE?

- Upscale canvas to Nearest Neighbor.
- It can go as high as you want, It is recommended to scale up to a factor of two. (e.g: 256px > 512px > 768 px > 2048px)

## > Easiest to Hardest weapons to make skins for? (Explanations are Under Construction)



### Shotgun
- simple and cube-like :)
- lots of surface area for decals and text and such.
- core shells use part of the barrel's texture, so you can have a cool core texture that you aren't gonna see much of in higher levels of play. oops.
### Revolver Arm
- very simple. you can add a decal to the palm and have something like a lil guy cheering you on as you play stylishly.
### Stock Revolver
- my template spreads out the colors but let me assure you that i don't know why it did that when i generated it, but it still works nicely.
### Feedbacker
- also very simple. has some seams but you can probably handle it.
### Alternate Revolver
- has weird UVs on the cylinder but behaves pretty nicely.
- you're gonna have trouble with the grip.
### Sawblade Launcher
- idk
### Knuckleblaster
- weird fucky UVs that'll take some time getting used to.
### Whiplash
- you got two models to worry about on one texture, this can only go so well.
### Nailgun
- actually quite simple and UVs are nice, but the lack of surface area could make it harder to add details on.
### Rocket Launcher
- the most horrifying UVs i've seen on the most perfect spot to put decals in. you just have to load the template yourself on the model and see for yourself.
### Impact Hammer
- the penultimate weapon to make a skin for. it has an emissive, sizeable flat areas, moving parts, and a speedometer that you can also change the texture of.
- it uses SEVEN textures in total, but only two-three textures are actually that important.
### Railcannon
- the ultimate challenge (in my opinion). i haven't made much of a detailed skin with this because of how little surface area it has AND how it doesn't have that much screentime with its instant swap speed.
