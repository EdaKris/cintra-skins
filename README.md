# How do I use my new skin in-game? (WIP)
1. Get [Ultraskins-GC](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/bobthecorn/ULTRASKINS_GC/) installed and do its initial setup.
2. For Windows users, go to `USERNAME\%APPDATA%\bobthecorn2000\ULTRAKILL\ultraskinsGC`. For Linux users, `.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/compatdata/1229490/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/bobthecorn2000/ULTRAKILL/ultraskinsGC`.
3. If you haven't already created a custom folder here, make one (any name works fine).
4. Copy/Move your newly created skin texture(s) here and rename them to their respective filenames. (e.g: your Slab Revolver skin has to be named `T_MinosRevolver_128.png`).
5. Open Ultrakill and click the US button.
6. Select the skin folder you just made.
7. Go to the Sandbox and see if your new skin looks good in-game. Make further adjustments if need be.
8. Play the game with your stylishly new skin!!!
