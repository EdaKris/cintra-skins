# What Is This?

This repo contains Blender files and my Skin Templates of the Ultrakill weapons and is meant to serve as a starting point for people who want to get into making their own custom skins for the game.

COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER:  
I do not own any of these weapon models, they belong to New Blood and the Ultrakill dev team. If anyone from New Blood wants this taken down, please do not hesitate to contact me.

All of the skin templates sample textures provided in the folder and `.blend` files are my modifications of the base textures.
