# What Is This?

![Repo Header](https://github.com/EdaKris/cintra-skins/blob/master/frontend/skin%20template%20wallpaper.png?raw=true "Cintra's Skin Templates")

This repo contains Blender files and `.psd` Skin Templates of the Ultrakill weapons and is meant to serve as a starting point for people who want to get into making their own custom skins for the game. 
# How to Make Skins with these? (WIP)
1. Open Blender and your image editing/painting software of choice.
2. Load the `.blend` file of the weapon you want to make a skin for.
3. Load `.psd` skin template you want on the model.
4. Change the colors of each part to your liking. (Hit save to see your progress on the blender model.)
5. Paint/Draw/Pase details that will enhance the overall theme of your skin.
6. Once you're done, export the texture as a `.png` file.
# How do I use my new skin in-game? (WIP)
1. Get [Ultraskins-GC](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/bobthecorn/ULTRASKINS_GC/) installed and do its initial setup.
2. For Windows users, go to `USERNAME\%APPDATA%\bobthecorn2000\ULTRAKILL\ultraskinsGC`. For Linux users, `.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/compatdata/1229490/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/bobthecorn2000/ULTRAKILL/ultraskinsGC`.
3. If you haven't already created a custom folder here, make one (any name works fine).
4. Copy/Move your newly created skin texture(s) here and rename them to their respective filenames. (e.g: your Slab Revolver skin has to be named `T_MinosRevolver_128.png`).
5. Open Ultrakill and click the US button.
6. Select the skin folder you just made.
7. Go to the Sandbox and see if your new skin looks good in-game. Make further adjustments if need be.
8. Play the game with your stylishly new skin!!! 
## Why use these? 
Because there's only so much you can do with the in-game Custom Colors.
